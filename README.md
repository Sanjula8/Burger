# Burger

This app uses SQL, ORM, Express, and Handlebars to create a Burger Eating App.

Based off the famous show, Bob's Burgers, this app allows you to eat famous burgers. Each burger in the waiting area has a `Eat` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page, where a `Delete` button will then appear. Clicking this button will remove it from the list on the right.

This app has also been deployed on Heroku here:
